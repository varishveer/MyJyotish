            <p class="text-justify">
                Kundali Matching, also known as horoscope matching or compatibility analysis, is a vital practice in Vedic astrology that assesses the compatibility between two individuals based on their birth charts. This process is commonly used in Indian culture to evaluate the suitability of prospective life partners and ensure a harmonious and successful marriage.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The practice of Kundali Matching involves comparing the birth charts of the bride and groom to determine their compatibility in various aspects of life. The main factors considered include:

                <strong>Gun Milan:</strong> This system evaluates the compatibility based on eight key attributes or 'Gunas,' such as mental compatibility, emotional harmony, and overall life path. The more Gunas matched, the higher the compatibility score.
                <strong>Dosha Analysis:</strong> This aspect examines any potential doshas or flaws in the Kundalis, such as Mangal Dosha (Mars defect) or Nadi Dosha, which may impact the relationship. Remedies are suggested to address these issues if necessary.
                <strong>Planetary Position:</strong> The placement of planets in each person’s chart is analyzed to understand how they will influence various aspects of married life, including health, wealth, and family dynamics.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The compatibility analysis helps in identifying strengths and potential challenges in the relationship. It offers valuable insights into how the couple can work together to build a successful and harmonious partnership.
