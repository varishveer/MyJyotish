            <p class="text-justify">
                Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian science of architecture and design that aims to create harmonious living spaces by aligning structures with the natural forces of the environment. Rooted in Vedic traditions, Vastu is believed to enhance well-being, prosperity, and happiness by ensuring that buildings and spaces are in harmony with cosmic principles.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                At its core, Vastu Shastra encompasses the principles of orientation, design, and spatial arrangement. It involves the meticulous planning of various elements such as the layout of rooms, placement of furniture, and the alignment of entrances to optimize energy flow and create a balanced environment. The fundamental aspects of Vastu include:

            <p class="text-justify">
                <strong>Orientation:</strong> The direction of a building and its rooms play a crucial role in Vastu. Proper orientation ensures that natural forces, such as sunlight and wind, are harnessed effectively to benefit the occupants.
                <strong>Layout:</strong> The arrangement of rooms and spaces within a building is designed to promote positive energy flow. For instance, the placement of the kitchen, bedrooms, and living areas is carefully considered to enhance comfort and functionality.
                <strong>Elements:</strong> Vastu incorporates the five elements—earth, water, fire, air, and space—into the design. Balancing these elements within a space helps create a harmonious and supportive environment.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                By adhering to Vastu principles, one can potentially improve various aspects of life, including health, wealth, relationships, and overall well-being. For instance, the correct placement of the main entrance, the use of specific colors, and the arrangement of furniture can have a significant impact on the energy and ambiance of a space.
