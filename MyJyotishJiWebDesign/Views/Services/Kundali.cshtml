            <p class="text-justify">
                Kundali, also known as a birth chart or horoscope, is a crucial component in Vedic astrology that provides a detailed map of the positions of celestial bodies at the exact moment of an individual's birth. This astrological chart is used to analyze various aspects of a person’s life, including personality traits, career prospects, relationships, and future events.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The Kundali is constructed based on the exact date, time, and place of birth, which allows astrologers to create a precise chart showing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets across the twelve astrological houses. Each house represents different facets of life, and the positions of the planets within these houses provide insights into various aspects of one's destiny.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                <strong>The Twelve Houses:</strong> Each house in the Kundali corresponds to specific areas of life, such as career, health, relationships, and wealth. The first house, known as the Ascendant or Lagna, represents the self and physical appearance. The seventh house pertains to marriage and partnerships, while the tenth house is associated with career and achievements.
                <strong>Planetary Positions:</strong> The placement of planets in these houses influences different aspects of life. For example, the position of Jupiter can impact one’s luck and growth, while the position of Mars might affect energy levels and assertiveness.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Additionally, the Kundali includes important aspects such as the Dasha system, which outlines the planetary periods affecting an individual at different times, and the Nakshatras, which are lunar constellations that play a role in shaping one’s characteristics and life events.
