                        Tarot is an ancient system of divination and self-reflection that has been used for centuries to gain insight into the past, present, and future. While its origins are somewhat unclear, it is widely believed to have emerged in the 15th century in Europe, initially as a card game. However, over time, Tarot was imbued with mystical and esoteric significance, becoming a popular tool for spiritual guidance and personal introspection.

                        A Tarot deck typically consists of 78 cards, divided into two main sections: the Major Arcana (22 cards) and the Minor Arcana (56 cards). Each card in the deck carries symbolic imagery and meanings that reflect different aspects of life, from personal experiences and emotions to larger spiritual journeys and universal themes.
