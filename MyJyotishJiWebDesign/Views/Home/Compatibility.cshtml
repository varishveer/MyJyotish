							Love compatibility is a fascinating concept that explores how two people with different personalities, values, and needs can come together in a harmonious relationship. While many factors influence compatibility, including shared interests, communication styles, and emotional connection, astrology offers a unique perspective on this subject. According to astrology, the positions and interactions of the planets at the time of a person’s birth can provide insights into their personality traits and the dynamics of their relationships.

							In astrology, compatibility between two individuals is often evaluated based on their sun signs. The sun sign is determined by the position of the Sun at the time of one’s birth and represents a person's core personality, ego, and identity. Each of the twelve zodiac signs has distinct qualities that influence how they approach life, love, and relationships. These signs are categorized into four elements—Fire, Earth, Air, and Water—which play a key role in determining compatibility.
