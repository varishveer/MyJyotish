                        Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian science of architecture and design that aims to create a harmonious environment by aligning the physical space with the natural elements and energies of the universe. It is based on the belief that the arrangement, orientation, and design of a structure can influence the health, wealth, prosperity, and well-being of its inhabitants. Rooted in the Vedic traditions, Vastu Shastra is a system that combines art, science, astrology, and philosophy to ensure that buildings and spaces support the optimal flow of positive energy, known as "prana."

                        The term Vastu translates to "building" or "dwelling" in Sanskrit, while Shastra means "science" or "doctrine." Together, the term refers to the science of constructing and arranging buildings in a way that fosters positive energy flow and brings balance to the environment. Vastu Shastra is often compared to feng shui, a Chinese system of harmonizing spaces, but Vastu Shastra is specifically rooted in the Indian tradition and incorporates spiritual, cosmic, and elemental principles.
