                        Astrology is an ancient belief system that posits a connection between the positions and movements of celestial bodies—such as the stars, planets, and the Moon—and events on Earth, including human behavior, personality traits, and even life’s larger patterns. According to astrology, the alignment of these celestial bodies at the time of one's birth influences their individual characteristics, life path, and experiences. While astrology is not recognized as a science by the scientific community, it has endured across centuries and cultures, remaining a popular tool for self-reflection, guidance, and prediction.

                        At its core, astrology is based on the idea that the universe is interconnected. The celestial bodies, which include the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, all affect the natural world and human affairs. Astrology divides the sky into twelve distinct sections, known as the zodiac signs, each representing different personality traits, behaviors, and tendencies. These signs are based on the position of the Sun relative to the stars at the time of one's birth. The twelve signs are grouped into four elements: Fire, Earth, Air, and Water, which symbolize different characteristics.

                        The twelve zodiac signs—Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces—are often the most widely recognized aspect of astrology. Each sign has distinct traits, such as Aries being assertive and energetic, while Cancer is known for being emotional and nurturing. The Sun sign, which is determined by the month and day of a person’s birth, is the most common astrological reference, but astrologers also look at other factors, including the Moon sign and Rising sign (Ascendant), for a more comprehensive understanding.
